# 🎵 MusicFy

**A full-stack music streaming app for mobile, built with bare React Native for maximum performance and flexibility.**

------

## 📱 Project Overview

**MusicFy** is a full-stack mobile music streaming application developed with **bare React Native**, paired with a **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB** backend. Built as a course project, the app reflects my deep dive into mobile app development beyond the convenience of Expo.

Key features include:

* Secure user authentication with **email verification** and **password reset**
* Music **uploading**, **streaming**, and **local caching** for smooth playback
* Support for **playlists**, **favorites**, **listening history**, and **user following**
* A basic **recommendation system** based on user behavior

The app stores audio files locally to reduce load times and deliver a smoother user experience.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main goal was to build a full-stack mobile application from the ground up without Expo, to better understand mobile app development, backend integration, and deployment.

Key objectives:

* Master **bare React Native**, native module linking, and deployment
* Implement secure user authentication flows
* Enable music and cover image uploads and streaming
* Support user-curated content like playlists and favorites
* Create a lightweight recommendation engine
* Optimize performance with **local caching**
* Design a scalable REST API with Node.js and MongoDB

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend (Mobile App)

* **React Native** – cross-platform mobile development without Expo
* **React Navigation** – screen transitions and routing
* **Redux** – global state management
* **React Query** – server state and data synchronization
* **Axios** – HTTP requests
* **AsyncStorage** – local storage for caching audio files

### Backend

* **Node.js + Express** – REST API and server-side logic
* **MongoDB + Mongoose** – database and data modeling
* **Formidable** – file upload handling
* **Nodemailer** – email verification and password reset
* **JWT** – stateless authentication
* **Bcrypt** – secure password hashing

### DevOps & Deployment

* **Docker** – containerized backend for consistent deployment
* **Caddy** – reverse proxy and HTTPS setup with automatic certificate management

## 💡 What I Learned

Building MusicFy gave me hands-on experience in full-stack mobile app development and exposed me to real-world challenges and solutions:

* **Bare React Native**: Learned manual linking, platform-specific configuration, and app deployment.
* **State Management**: Gained expertise in managing both client and server state with Redux and React Query.
* **Authentication**: Implemented email verification and password reset flows securely.
* **Full-Stack Architecture**: Designed RESTful APIs, handled file uploads, and managed users/music in MongoDB.
* **Audio Caching**: Improved UX by caching audio locally, learning the importance of mobile performance.
* **Deployment**: Used Docker and Caddy to streamline deployments and enable secure API access.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

To further enhance MusicFy, I plan to implement the following improvements:

1. ✅ **Automated Testing** – Unit, integration, and E2E tests
2. 🔁 **CI/CD Pipeline** – Automate builds, tests, and releases
3. ⚡ **Redis/CDN Caching** – Improve performance and scalability
4. 🔒 **Rate Limiting & Load Balancing** – Strengthen security and reliability
5. 🌐 **Internationalization (i18n)** – Multi-language support
6. 📝 **Lyrics Support** – Display synced/static lyrics during playback
7. 🧠 **Advanced Recommendations** – Use ML or collaborative filtering
8. 🔔 **Push Notifications** – Notify users of updates and activity
9. 📤 **Social Sharing** – Share music and playlists across platforms

These updates aim to make MusicFy more feature-rich, performant, and user-friendly.
